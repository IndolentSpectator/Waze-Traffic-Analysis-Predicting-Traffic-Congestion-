📌 Project Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze traffic congestion patterns using data from Waze. The objective is to develop predictive models that help commuters, urban planners, and traffic management authorities optimize travel routes and reduce congestion in real-time.

📝 Business Understanding

🎯 Business Need and Objective

Traffic congestion is a critical challenge in urban areas, leading to delays, increased fuel consumption, and inefficient city infrastructure. Leveraging Waze real-time data, we aim to:

Predict congestion levels based on various traffic parameters.

Provide insights into congestion patterns at different times and locations.

Help optimize travel routes for efficient navigation.

🚦 Stakeholders

Commuters: Optimize routes and avoid traffic hotspots.

Traffic Management Authorities: Improve road conditions and manage congestion.

Urban Planners: Identify high-risk congestion zones and enhance city infrastructure.

🗂️ Data Understanding & Feature Engineering

📂 Dataset

Source: Waze real-time traffic dataset.

Attributes: Road conditions, accident reports, congestion levels, GPS data.

Target Variable: congestion_level (categorical/binary classification).

🔎 Feature Engineering

Time-based Features: Hour of the day, weekday vs. weekend effects.

Weather Conditions: Rain, temperature, visibility impact.

Road Incident Reports: Accidents, roadblocks, police alerts.

Historical Traffic Data: Moving averages of past congestion trends.

🏗️ Modeling & Evaluation

🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

Logistic Regression (Baseline model)

Decision Trees (Interpretable classification)

Random Forests (Ensemble learning for better accuracy)

Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM) (Advanced modeling for better generalization)

Deep Learning (LSTMs for time series forecasting) (Optional for long-term congestion predictions)

📊 Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy – Measures overall correctness.

Precision & Recall – Balancing false positives and false negatives.

F1-Score – A weighted average of precision and recall.

ROC-AUC Score – Evaluates model robustness.

⚖️ Ethical Considerations

🚨 Key Issues

Data Privacy: Ensuring anonymized and aggregated usage.

Bias in Predictions: Preventing over-representation of high-density urban areas.

False Congestion Alerts: Avoiding unnecessary route diversions for commuters.

The model will focus on:

Regular fairness testing across locations.

Improved feature selection to reduce bias.

Transparent user feedback integration.

🏆 Conclusion & Recommendations

✅ Key Findings

Traffic congestion follows peak-hour patterns with major delays in city centers.

Weather conditions impact congestion, with rainy conditions leading to longer travel times.

Accidents and roadblocks significantly contribute to traffic slowdowns.

🚀 Next Steps

Integrate real-time weather API for improved accuracy.

Enhance deep learning models (LSTMs) for sequential forecasting.

Deploy a real-time API for commuter use.
